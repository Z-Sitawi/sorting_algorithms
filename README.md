# sorting_algorithms
* In this project, I had to learn new interesting concepts such as linear search & binary search.
* Then I familiarized myself with The Big O Notation concept, which taught me that my code the efficiency of my code is very important when dealing with huge amounts of data.
* Then I was introduced to different types of sorting (selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, ...)
